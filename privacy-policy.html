        <h1>Privacy Policy for HangApp</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated: January 28, 2026</strong></p>

        <p>HangApp is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share
            information when you use our mobile application, HangApp, available on the Google Play Store.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p><strong>Precise Location Data:</strong> We collect your precise location information only when you explicitly
            interact with the "check-in" feature. This allows you to notify your friends of your current venue. HangApp
            does <strong>not</strong> track your location in the background or when the app is closed. Your location is
            only ever visible to your friends.</p>
        <p><strong>Contact & Social Data:</strong> To facilitate connections, we access only email addresses to connect
            you with your friends.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the data collected to facilitate spontaneous hangouts by sharing your check-in status with confirmed
            friends and to improve the functionality of the application.</p>

        <h2>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p><strong>Visibility to Friends:</strong> Your location and check-in status are only visible to users you have
            confirmed as "Friends" within the app. We do not sell or trade your personal information to third parties.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <p>You may delete individual check-ins from your history at any time. If you choose to delete your account, all
            personal data and location history will be permanently erased from our servers within 30 days.</p>

        <h2>5. Security</h2>
        <p>We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access.</p>

        <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, please contact us via our developer profile on the Google
            Play Store.</p>
